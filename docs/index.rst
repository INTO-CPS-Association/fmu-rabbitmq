Welcome to INTO-CPS Maestro's documentation!
============================================
Maestro2 is for specifying and executing co-simulations based on the Functional Mock-up Interface. 
It features a domain specific language called Mastro Base Language (MaBL) along with a parser and an interpreter. 
Furthermore, it makes it possible to write plugins that can either expand to MaBL code or execute in the interpreter.
